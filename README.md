# Volcano 🌋

A micro flat-file blog and website constructor.

## Features

- No database
- Fast
- Easy to use
- You write your content in beautiful Markdown
- Great with custom designs

## Requirements

- PHP 8.0.0 or higher
- Support for `mod_rewrite` ([how to set up](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-mod_rewrite))

## Getting Started

```bash
cd ~/path/to/project

composer require sebastianks/volcano

# IMPORTANT
# Copy a slim starter template bundled with Volcano.
cp -r vendor/sebastianks/volcano/setup/* .
```

Volcano will now serve your app from `/site/theme/index.php` which at it's lightest can be as slim as:

```php
<?php

# Get our App instance
$app = require __DIR__ . '/../../app.php';

# This is where the magic happens 🧙‍♂️
echo $app->render();
```

That is Volcano at it's barebones. A more realistic real-life example can be found [in the Wiki](https://github.com/sebastianks/volcano/wiki/The-Simple-Starter).
